# Contributing code to the otfi repository

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to otfi must be accompanied by sign-off text that indicates
acceptance of the Contributor License Agreement (see [CLA](CLA) for full
text), which is closely derived from the Apache Individual Contributor License
Agreement. The sign-off text must be included once per commit, in the commit
message. The sign-off can be automatically inserted using a command such as
`git commit -s`, which will generate the text in the form:
`Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>`

By adding this sign-off, you are certifying:

_By signing-off on this submission, I agree to be bound by the terms of the
Contributor License Agreement located at the root of the project repository,
and I agree that this submission constitutes a "Contribution" under that
Agreement._

Please note that this project and any contributions to it are public and that
a record of all contributions (including any personal information submitted
with it, including a sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
involved.
